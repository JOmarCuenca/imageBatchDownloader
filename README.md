# Python Img Batch Downloader

This program was intended to be used as an example of how to integrate the **progressbar2** python package.

I leave it here for anyone to use at their leisure.

I do recomend creating a Virtual Env first so not to mix Development Environments.

## Execution

The Program is intended to run like so:

```
python3 batchDownload.py <<filename.csv>>
```

Or if you need to run it with an Excel File instead of a CSV Files:

```
python3 batchDownload.py <<filename.xlsx>> --xlsx
```

For more info run:

```
python3 batchDownload.py -h
```
